dottie retired from lockheed aircraft corporation in marietta as an administrative assistant in flight test engineering. after moving to fairfax county virginia, she was employed by george mason university where she taught and directed the english and reading remedial student program and was awarded the honor of distinguished employee for service to students and to the university for her work in that program.
above all, dottie's love of god was primary. she was a bible scholar and held strong religious beliefs. she learned bible from her father, ""mr. jim"" davenport, who was a lifelong bible teacher at mars hill presbyterian church in acworth, ga. her church family in anniston was the members at faith presbyterian church who she dearly loved. also, she often said that one of her greatest accomplishments was being a charter member of and helping to form the covenant presbyterian church in marietta, ga. her faith ran deep and she believed that every day that she lived on earth was a gift from god and that she was always ready to go home to heaven whenever god decided it was time. that time to go home to heaven came on thursday, may 2, 2019, at nhc healthcare in anniston, al where she was a resident for the last six and one-half years. 
secondary to love of god was dottie's love of and devotion to family, including those who had already gone to heaven ahead of her. family brought her much joy and happiness for over 100 years. preceding her in death were her parents, james mark and odessa mae (west) davenport, her two brothers, james and william (bill) davenport, two sisters, carolyn hester and infant sister, edith ann davenport. survivors include her husband, william (bill) brazelton of anniston, al, one sister, sara cadenhead, of austell, ga (paul); three sons, lloyd blackwell of grand forks, nd (patricia), phil blackwell of marietta, ga (diane), and william brazelton, jr. of broken arrow, ok; four grandsons, shane brazelton of broken arrow, ok, noah brazelton of broken arrow, ok, nate brazelton of broken arrow, ok, and josh brazelton of broken arrow, ok; four granddaughters, leslie liles of fresno, ca (linda), meredith weber of kennesaw, ga (bill), alice blackwell of alexandria, la (christof stumpf), and laura blackwell of walnut creek, ca (dennis hwang); three great granddaughters, abby weber of kennesaw, ga, tanith hwang of walnut creek, ca, and seraphina hwang of walnut creek, ca.
other facts about and interests of dottie's are:
 she was an avid reader and was known to consume a novel in one day. in later years, she read the daily newspaper and a selection of favorite magazines.
 she was an author of many poems and short stories and wrote a book of her memories at the age of 91 which she gifted to family members.
 she was a lifetime member of the women's clubs sponsored by the cooperative extension service of the u.s. government. while living in virginia she served as state scholarship chairman for the purpose of honoring deserving young women graduates of virginia high schools. 
 she was an independent spirit who held moderately conservative values and political beliefs. she seldom missed the ""obligation' to vote.
 she was creative which was exemplified through her writings. she was artistic and in mid-life studied painting and produced several water colors which hang on walls of her home and homes of other family members. she was musical and loved church hymns that she could mostly sing from memory, and she loved classical string music.
 when most people described dottie they mostly described what a beautiful person she was, both outside and inside. she is also remembered for having a ""green thumb"" and for the beautiful flowers she grew in her yard wherever she lived.
 as much as she could, she loved travel and adventure. otherwise she traveled through her readings of literature and books. her most memorable trip was the one she took to europe during the summer of 1990 with other family members. traveling through eastern europe at that time when the u.s.s.r. was being dissolved was especially meaningful. she took great delight in using a hand pick to personally do her part of chipping-away at the berlin wall as it was being torn down. 
 dottie was always very social, though those opportunities were more limited in recent years due to her poor health. however, on those days when she felt her best, she would still initiate and hold her own in a discussion.

she also enjoyed working with children and teenagers at bethlehem first congregational methodist church in walnut grove, alabama, where she was a member for over 50 years. because of love for the youth whom she served, vacation bible school was very special to her. she left behind a testimony of peace in christ, and her legacy of love will continue on in the hearts of all those she touched. heaven's gain is earth's great loss.

an outstanding student at clintonville high school, dorothy was part of the state champion debate team of 1932. she argued their winning case before a panel seated in the wisconsin state supreme court chambers. family finances and the depression put college out of reach for dorothy, but she continued her intellectual pursuits through the sarah doty study club, various bridge clubs and book clubs (including neenah's ytnf -- yesterday today and forever -- club in which she was the only non-college grad), and as a neenah middle school assistant librarian.

dorothy and vern met at kimberly-clark paper company where she was a payroll clerk and he was an engineer. in accord with depression protocols, as soon as dorothy got married she was out of a job. vern's work took the young family to terrace bay, ontario for a few years in the late 1940's and early 1950s, then back to neenah where dorothy applied her significant intelligence, energy and sense of civic responsibility to volunteer work for the red cross, league of women voters, first united methodist church, and theda clark hospital. and she loved to dance.

dorothy and larry met at the first united methodist church in neenah. after they married in 1968, dorothy helped raise larry's two teenage sons. once the sons left home the couple downsized to a smaller home nearby where they lived until moving to evergreen manor in oshkosh. dorothy and larry shared a love of family, church, their large garden, neenah high school sporting events, and the green bay packers as well as travel and lifelong learning. in addition to their honeymoon trip to europe, the couple took an annual winter trip to florida, many elderhostel travel tours, and twice drove to alaska.

after she and larry moved into evergreen manor in 1997, dorothy sang in the evergreen choir and continued to grace any available dance floor. always beautifully coiffed and dressed, she made many friends over her life-time, touching them all with her thoughtfulness, wit, and love of fun. friends and family alike describe her as ""the embodiment of grace"", ""kindness itself"", and ""an inspiration"".

to know krista was to know love. she insisted on helping anyone she could and would often leave at a moment's notice to offer a ride, pick up a grandchild, jump start a car or to just to hold your hand. she had a passion for camping with her husband and would rather watch disney movies with her grandchildren than do anything else on earth. she was a phenomenal wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend and loved everyone around her without judgement. when she entered a room, you knew it! her boisterous laughter and larger than life personality left an imprint on anyone who met her. she was a fierce mother and grandmother who would do anything for her children and grandchildren. most of all, she was herself, unapologetically, and she taught her children and grandchildren that being authentic would get you further in life than pretending to be someone you are not. krista had solutions for everything and often had plans in place far before she talked it over with anyone. she was a strong woman, who had seen her fair share of hardship and shared those lessons with all who would listen. she made strangers her friends, she loved all creatures and she always stood up for what was right. she will be deeply missed by her family who have not yet figured out how they will go on without her.

krista had so many talents. she loved to garden and could effortlessly landscape any space. from the beauty of her own garden to her landscaping work at her sister's home, she was beyond creative and could easily use whatever materials available to her to create beautiful masterpieces. whether it was an electrical problem, dilapidated furniture, stuffed animals with missing ears, complicated sewing projects, tiling bathrooms, grouting floors, renovating rooms, staining wood or assembling the most complicated of dressers from ikea krista always figured it out. no project was too big. even during her days when she felt ill, she would still find the strength to help out whenever she could.

her grandchildren were her true joy. she spent countless hours attending sporting events, talent shows, plays and concerts. she spent a substantial amount of time with all of her grandchildren and in turn developed a close and special bond with all seven of them who knew her lovingly as ""nana."" there was no better house than nana's house and spending time there meant fruit snacks for breakfast, sugar toast for lunch and pancakes for dinner. nana's way was always the right way and movie nights were a special tradition as she was just excited as they were to watch the newest animated movie. all of her grandchildren have amazing memories of her love for them. although she loved them all the same, she had a special way of making each one feel as they were her favorite.",5,5,5,5,5,NA,1,4,1,5,5,2,0.0653710247349823,0.049469964664311,0.0671378091872792,0.0265017667844523,0.0265017667844523,0.104240282685512,0.0918727915194346,0.0265017667844523,0.0583038869257951,0.0265017667844523,0.0600706713780919,0.0247349823321555,0.0123674911660777,0.0795053003533569,0.0830388692579505,0.0212014134275618,0.00176678445229682,0.0477031802120141,0.03886925795053,0.03886925795053,0.0212014134275618,0.0123674911660777,0.0795053003533569,0.0600706713780919,0.0123674911660777,0.00353356890459364,0.0300353356890459,0.0335689045936396,0.00706713780918728,0,0,0.0477031802120141,0.0106007067137809,0.019434628975265,0.0212014134275618,0,0.00176678445229682,0.0088339222614841,0.0406360424028269,0.00176678445229682,0.00176678445229682,0.0141342756183746,0.00353356890459364,0.00530035335689046,0.00353356890459364,0.00176678445229682,0.00176678445229682,0.0088339222614841,0.00530035335689046,0.00530035335689046,0.00530035335689046,0.0088339222614841,0.00176678445229682,0.00176678445229682,0,0.00176678445229682,0.00353356890459364,0.00353356890459364,0.0159010600706714,0.0229681978798587,0.0371024734982332,0.0141342756183746,0.00176678445229682,0.00530035335689046,0.068904593639576,0.0512367491166078,0.0636042402826855,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,22,3,34,13,2,22,46,11
