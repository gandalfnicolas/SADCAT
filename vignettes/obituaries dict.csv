gathering great gift love fierce protective endure","his family emigrated from england to republic, mi in the u.p., later moving to detroit where charles was born, and finally settling in flint where he grew up and met his beloved wife of 61 years, joanne. after their marriage they moved to ann arbor where charles completed his undergraduate and graduate studies in engineering at the university of michigan, and helped develop the university's michigan instructional computer, or mic system. his love of engineering opened the door to careers with bendix corp., where he worked on the apollo 11, 13 and 14 missions as well as the viking mission to mars, and later as an automotive engineering consultant with ford, and as a software developer with software services. a lifetime member of the masons, he grew up with an appreciation of faith and the importance of giving and community. as a member of dixboro united methodist church, charles served in a variety of capacities from lay minister to computer networking consultant to judas in the living last supper. he also enjoyed a wide variety of activities and hobbies that he delighted in sharing with others (most of which also included some element of engineering), including stunt kite flying, building and racing remote-control cars, coin and stamp collecting, sailing up north every summer at the place they honeymooned (often falling asleep and drifting peacefully along), space and astronomy, puzzles of all kinds, robotics in any form, and just plain tinkering around. he was fascinated with all aspects of technology, and marveled that the room-sized computer he designed as a grad student now fit in the palm of his hand. the proud father of three daughters, charles instilled in them the belief they could do anything they set their minds to and he expected nothing less. he taught them to solder circuit boards and program computers, hang drywall and build a bedroom, change the oil in a car and use every tool known to man (which he had in triplicate), a fine appreciation of power tools and working hard, using your mind and making it work. his greatest life lesson was his unending generosity: to give of yourself to
