to know krista was to know love. she insisted on helping anyone she could and would often leave at a moment's notice to offer a ride, pick up a grandchild, jump start a car or to just to hold your hand. she had a passion for camping with her husband and would rather watch disney movies with her grandchildren than do anything else on earth. she was a phenomenal wife, mother, grandmother, sister and friend and loved everyone around her without judgement. when she entered a room, you knew it! her boisterous laughter and larger than life personality left an imprint on anyone who met her. she was a fierce mother and grandmother who would do anything for her children and grandchildren. most of all, she was herself, unapologetically, and she taught her children and grandchildren that being authentic would get you further in life than pretending to be someone you are not. krista had solutions for everything and often had plans in place far before she talked it over with anyone. she was a strong woman, who had seen her fair share of hardship and shared those lessons with all who would listen. she made strangers her friends, she loved all creatures and she always stood up for what was right. she will be deeply missed by her family who have not yet figured out how they will go on without her.

krista had so many talents. she loved to garden and could effortlessly landscape any space. from the beauty of her own garden to her landscaping work at her sister's home, she was beyond creative and could easily use whatever materials available to her to create beautiful masterpieces. whether it was an electrical problem, dilapidated furniture, stuffed animals with missing ears, complicated sewing projects, tiling bathrooms, grouting floors, renovating rooms, staining wood or assembling the most complicated of dressers from ikea krista always figured it out. no project was too big. even during her days when she felt ill, she would still find the strength to help out whenever she could.
